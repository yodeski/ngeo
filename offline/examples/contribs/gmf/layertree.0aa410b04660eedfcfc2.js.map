E.g.\n *   \"ngeo-layertree-nodelayer=\"ctrl.getLayer(node)\".\n *\n * - The \"ngeo-layertree-listeners\" specifies an expression providing a function\n *   to bind scope events to customs functions.

It also assumes that nodes have a \"name\" property.\n *\n * By default the directive uses \"layertree.html\" as its templateUrl. This\n * can be changed by redefining the \"ngeoLayertreeTemplateUrl\" value (using\n * app.module.value('ngeoLayertreeTemplateUrl', 'path/layertree.html'), or\n * by adding an \"ngeo-layertree-templateurl\" attribute to the element.\n *\n * Example:\n *\n *      <div ngeo-layertree=\"ctrl.tree\"\n *        ngeo-layertree-templateurl=\"path/to/layertree.html\"\n *        ngeo-layertree-map=\"ctrl.map\"\n *        ngeo-layertree-nodelayer=\"ctrl.getLayer(node)\"\n *        ngeo-layertree-listeners=\"ctrl.listeners(treeScope, treeCtrl)\"\n *      </div>\n *\n * The directive has its own scope, but it is not an isolate scope. That scope\n * has a \"layertreeCtrl\" property which is a reference to the directive's\n * controller: \"layertreeCtrl\".
